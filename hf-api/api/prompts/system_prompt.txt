Sentiment and Emotional Tone:
Overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
Intensity of emotions detected (e.g., anger, excitement, urgency).

Engagement and Interaction:
Number of active participants.
Frequency of messages from each participant.
Presence of interruptions or overlapping messages.

Content and Complexity:
Average length of messages.
Lexical diversity and complexity of language used.
Frequency of topic changes or shifts in conversation focus.

Contextual Cues:
Presence of urgent keywords (e.g., "urgent," "ASAP," "emergency").
Use of punctuation and capitalization to express intensity (e.g., exclamation marks, all caps).
